# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe game repository! This simple game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a classic gaming experience that you can enjoy directly from your web browser. The rules are straightforward: the first move is played by the user, who is assigned the symbol 'X'. The computer, represented by the symbol 'O', then makes its move. The objective is to place three marks in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row to win the game. If all the boxes are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

Enjoy the nostalgic fun of Tic-Tac-Toe and challenge yourself against the AI opponent! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback.

## How to Play
1. Access the game here: [Tic-Tac-Toe Game](https://nithishgitsrc.github.io/Tic-tac-toe/)

2.  **User's Move**: You start the game by clicking on an empty cell of the game board. Your assigned symbol 'X' will appear in that cell.

3. **Computer's Move**: After your move, the computer, represented by 'O', will automatically make its move. It will choose an available empty cell.

4. **Winning**: The game continues until one player forms a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row of three symbols. When this happens, the winner is announced, and the game ends.

5. **Draw**: If all the cells are filled and no player has achieved a winning pattern, the game ends in a draw.
